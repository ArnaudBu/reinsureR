Description: Application of reinsurance treaties to claims portfolio. 
            The package creates a class Claims whose objective is to store claims and premiums,
            on which different treaties can be applied. Methods are then implemented to measure
            the impact of reinsurance on portfolios. This package aims at constructing a
            framework for the burning cost approach for reinsurance.
