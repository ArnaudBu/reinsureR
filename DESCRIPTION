Description: Application of reinsurance treaties to claims portfolios. 
            The package creates a class Claims whose objective is to store claims and premiums,
            on which different treaties can be applied. A statistical analysis can then be applied to measure the impact of reinsurance, producing a table or graphical output. This package can be used for estimating the impact of reinsurance on several portfolios or for pricing treaties through statistical analysis.
